# Matching tool Template

Automates matching of values and names through GAS (Google Apps Script).

This is a generic template inspired by common spreadsheet reconciliation patterns. It contains no proprietary code or data.

# Audit / Reconciliation Template

This repository also includes a generic audit template that:

- Compares two data sources by exact amount (cents)
- Produces "missing on A" and "missing on B" reports
- Calculates totals and differences
- Supports optional enrichment via a third lookup sheet

The audit logic is intentionally generic and contains no proprietary workflows.
